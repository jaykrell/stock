/*
Question statement
# Given predicted stock prices for next n days for a stock, find the maximum
# profit that can be made with a single buy-sell transaction (e.g. you can buy
# single share of stock on one day, and then sell it on a subsequent day).  If
# no profit can be made return 0.


# For example, given this list of daily stock predictions:
# (20, 40, 52, 15, 18, 50, 20, 45),
# buying at 15 and selling at 50 gives maximum profit of 35.
